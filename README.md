# Block Party
## Made for HobbyHacks 2020 by Jessica Cheng and Jennifer Guo

### Purpose
We made Block Party for the music category because we realized that people missed connecting with both their friends and strangers through music. 
In Block Party, users first either create or join a room.  You can join a room using a room code provided by a friend or join a room with other people near you.  
Everyone in the same room will be listening to the same song and can add and skip songs in the shared song queue!

### Software Details
We made Block Party using React, Firebase, the Youtube API, and radar.io.  
In order to navigate through the pages and place people in rooms, we use React Router, along with a firebase backend.
The user can choose to join rooms nearby them, and we used radar.io to both create and detect these rooms.
Lastly, in order to search, add, and play the songs in the Block Party room, we used the Youtube API.
